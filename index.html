    <h1>For You, My Love</h1>

    <p class="love-letter">
      The love I have for you is grander than you could ever imagine.
      Ever since the moment I met you, I knew I needed that lol.
      There was something about your smile, your energy, and the way you carried
      yourself that pulled me in instantly. And ever since you became my girlfriend,
      I’ve been having the best time of my life. Every second with you feels like
      pure bliss. You make my days softer, my nights calmer, and my whole world brighter.
      Being with you has shown me a kind of happiness I didn’t even know I was missing,
      and I'm grateful for every moment we share.
    </p>
