        <p>
            The love I have for you is grander than you could ever imagine. Ever since the moment I met you, 
            I knew I needed that lol. There was something about your smile, your energy, and the way you carried 
            yourself that pulled me in instantly.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Ever since you became my girlfriend, I’ve been having the best time of my life. Every second with you 
            feels like pure bliss. You make my days softer, my nights calmer, and my whole world brighter.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Even when we’re apart, you still manage to feel close, and I’m grateful for every memory, every call, 
            every message, and every moment that has you in it.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:10px;">With all my love,<br>Bryan</p>
